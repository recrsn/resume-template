# A resume builder

This is a simple resume builder template that takes a JSON file and generates a resume in HTML and PDF format.

## Usage

1. [Click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=resume-template&template_owner=recrsn) to create a new repository using this as a template. _I strongly recommend you to **keep the repository private.**_
   This avoids exposing your personal information to the wider internet.
